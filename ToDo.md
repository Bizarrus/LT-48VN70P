# ToDo #

**1. Network capturing**

The first step is, to capture the network traffic from the SmartTV. Currently the Device is directly connected over Wifi with my Router.

Currently i prepare my unused `Raspberry Pi 3 B+` for using as Access-Point.

Than the SmartTV will be connected no longer directly with my Router but witn my `Raspberry Pi`. Here i can log the network traffic.

If the connection is successfully, i try to search over the SmartTV-Settings a new version of the firmware. If this step works, i can simulate the update-check process to get the original firmware (i hope)

**2. Getting/Analysing Firmware**

After **Step 1** was complete, i will analyse the latest firmware.
